## 1-MPC Classifier

This Python project, named "MPC Classifier," is designed for performing facial classification using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The goal of this project is to classify faces into two categories, making it a binary classification problem. According to the evaluation results, the model does not exhibit overfitting or underfitting issues and achieves satisfactory accuracy on both the training and test datasets.
